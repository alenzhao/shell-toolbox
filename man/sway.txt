     The sswwaayy utility monitors the average system load and signals the
     specified process when the load reaches a certain level.

     The process may be started by the utility, or it may be an already
     running process specified through its process ID.

     The process will recieve a STOP signal when the load is too high.
     Alternatively, a TERM signal may be sent to terminate the process.  When
     the load has dropped below safe levels again, a CONT signal will be sent
     (unless the process was terminated).

     --cc _L_O_W  Send a CONT signal to the process when the average system load
             goes beneath _L_O_W.

             By default, _L_O_W will be approximately 60% of the upper load value
             specified with --ss _H_I_G_H, or 1.5 if that option is not used.

     --hh      Display brief usage information.

     --kk      Send a TERM signal to terminate the process at high load levels,
             rather than stopping it with a STOP signal.

             If this option is used, this utility will exit after sending the
             signal.

     --mm _N    Monitor the average system load every _N seconds.  The monitoring
             is done using the uuppttiimmee command and is using the 5 minute load
             value.

             By default, monitoring is done every 30 seconds.

     --pp _p_i_d  Instead of signalling a process initiated by this utility, send
             the signals to the already running process whose process ID is
             _p_i_d.

     --ss _H_I_G_H
             Send the STOP signal (or TERM if --kk is used) to the process if
             the average system load exceeds _H_I_G_H.

             The default value for _H_I_G_H is 2.5.

     _c_m_d     A command to run and manage.

     The sswwaayy utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
