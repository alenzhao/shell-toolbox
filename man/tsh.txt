     The ttsshh utility starts a new shell with minimal environment in a work
     directory.

     --dd      Delete the work directory when exiting.

             This is done using “rm -rf dir” where “dir” is the work directory
             specified on the command line, or the temporary directory that
             was created if no directory was specified.

             If the HUP (hangup) signal is received, the work directory will
             _n_o_t be deleted when exiting.

     --hh      Displays brief usage information.

     --ss _s_h_e_l_l
             Starts shell “shell”.

             The shell is required to be an absolute path listed in
             “/etc/shells”.

             Defaults to “/bin/sh”.

     _d_i_r     Use work directory “dir”.

             If “dir” does not already exist, it will be created.

             An empty temporary work directory will be created if no directory
             is specified.

     The environment is cleared and the invoked shell will have LC_ALL set to
     “C” by this utility.
