Run a shell for testing things.

Starts a new shell with mimimal environment in a work directory.
The shell will have LC_ALL=C set in its environment.

Usage:

    ./bin/tsh [-d] [-s shell] [dir]

    ./bin/tsh -h

Options:

    -d          Delete the work directory when exiting.

                This is done using "rm -rf dir" where 'dir' is the
                work directory specified on the command line, or the
                temporary directory that was created if no directory was
                specified.

                If the HUP (hangup) signal is received, the work
                directory will *not* be deleted when exiting.

    -h          Displays this usage information.

    -s shell    Start shell 'shell'.

                The 'shell' is required to be listed in "/etc/shells".

                Defaults to "/bin/sh".

    dir         Use work directory 'dir'.

                If 'dir' does not exist, it will be created.

                An empty temporary work directory will be created if no
                directory is specified.
