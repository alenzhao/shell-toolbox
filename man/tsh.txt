     ttsshh – Set up a minimal shell environment ("test shell").

SSYYNNOOPPSSIISS
     ttsshh [--dd] [--ss _s_h_e_l_l] [_d_i_r]
     ttsshh --hh

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The ttsshh utility starts a new shell with minimal environment in a work
     directory.  The minimal environment will have LC_ALL set to "C" but will,
     apart from that, be empty, unless modified by shell initialization
     scripts.

     --dd      Delete the work directory when exiting.

             This is done using rrmm --rrff _d_i_r, where _d_i_r is the work directory
             specified on the command line, or the temporary directory that
             was created if no directory was specified.

             If the USR1 signal is received, the work directory will _n_o_t be
             deleted when exiting.

     --hh      Display brief usage information.

     --ss _s_h_e_l_l
             Start shell _s_h_e_l_l.

             The shell is required to be an absolute path listed in
             _/_e_t_c_/_s_h_e_l_l_s.

             Defaults to _/_b_i_n_/_s_h.

     _d_i_r     Use work directory _d_i_r.

             If _d_i_r does not already exist, it will be created.

             An empty temporary work directory will be created using mmkktteemmpp --dd
             if no directory is specified.

     The ttsshh utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
